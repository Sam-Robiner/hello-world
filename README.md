“The true Southern watermelon is a boon apart, and is not to be mentioned with commoner things. It is chief of this world’s luxuries, king by the grace of God over all the fruits of the earth. When one has tasted it, he knows what the angels eat. It was not a Southern watermelon that Eve took: we know it because she repented.” – Mark Twain, Pudd’nhead Wilson
